## Continue from here
- User can change number selection. Done. add e2e-test?
- UI: button toggle for users selected numbers. DONE. Add e2e-test?
- Start Lottery button is disabled until seven numbers are selected.
- check flexbox for usernumbers
- user's Winning numbers are highlighted/shown.

## Purpose
- Learn to create a single page react app in practise
- Learn to use backend that connects to db
- learn to create UI using a CDN

## MVP
1. User can select lotto numbers. App draws random lotto numbers. User sees how many numbers are correct.
-- user can only select seven numbers. Show error message, if user tries to select more than seven.
2. Nice UI for app (use CDN).
3. Implement error handling messages (remove alert boxes).
4. User can select amount of money she bets.
5. User sees history of lottonumbers being drawn.

## Nice to have
- user can 

## States
- Drawed seven numbers, array, e.g. [1, 4, 12, 23, 24, 29, 36]
- User selected numbers, array, e.g. [2, 7, 13, 23, 27, 30, 32]

## UI
- number icons, can be selected
- Start lotto button
- reset selection button

## Components
- App
  - NumberGrid
    - Number
  - UserButtons
  - InfoBox

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
